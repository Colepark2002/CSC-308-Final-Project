To test the program:
Fresh Account (proficiency 0):
Username: test
Password: 123

1. Maximize the window
2. Select a problem from problem drop-down on the menu bar (Only Problem One will load due to having 0 proficiency).
3. To solve the problem, begin to create a UML diagram on the right panel by clicking and entering a Class name.
4. Right click on class boxes to add methods and variables
5. Add connections between the boxes by specifying a connection type using the connections menu and by clicking between two classes.
6. Between Adding classes you can use the check button in the bottom right to see the current source code of your UML or 
    figure out what you might be missing by using the hint button. 
7. When the problem looks correct hit the submit button to check correctness (if you make an incorrect connection, method, variable, or class use the clear button.
8. After succesfully solving the problem check your proficiency to see if it has increased with the proficiency button. Problems 2 and 3 can only be completed after the    previousproblems have been correctly submitted.

9. If you rerun the program you may use the analytics button to see a chart showing the percentage of users in each proficiency category.

You can also create and load your own problems by clearing the screen, then creating your desired UML.
    Next, save the problem from the menu bar with a file name and proficiency. Then, select "load" in
    the menu bar and enter the file name to load the code for your problem in the text area.
